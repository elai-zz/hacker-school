{"name":"Mocky","tagline":"A single parameter pattern matching library in JS","body":"### This is Mocky.\r\nMocky is a small JavaScript library with no dependencies. Mocky allows you to accomplish pattern matching found in functional programming languages such as ML, Haskell, Erlang, and OCaml in JavaScript. Currently, Mocky is capable of pattern matching with one parameter (see below examples). There are plans in the future to expand, or feel free to contribute. Mocky uses Jasmine testing framework and another library similar to Mocky is [Funcy](https://github.com/bramstein/funcy).\r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\nSimply include mocky.js in your .html file. \r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n1. Make a new Mocky object and load object with patterns. For anObj (below), if you call anObj(2), you'll get 3. If you call anObj(3), you'll invoke the anonymous function that would call some function foo() and return \"b1\" as a result from \"b\" + 1. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar anObj = mocky(\r\n\t[2,3], \r\n\t[1,2],\r\n\t[3 , function() {\r\n\t\ta = foo();\r\n\t\treturn \"b\" + 1}],\r\n\t[\"apple\", function (n) { return \"I like \" + n}],\r\n\t[_, \"wow!\"]\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
