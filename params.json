{"name":"Mocky","tagline":"A single parameter pattern matching library in JS","body":"### This is Mocky.\r\nMocky is a small JavaScript library with no external dependencies. Mocky allows you to accomplish pattern matching found in functional programming languages such as ML, Haskell, Erlang, and OCaml in JavaScript. Currently, Mocky is capable of pattern matching with one parameter (see below examples). There are plans in the future to expand, or feel free to contribute. Mocky was tested using the Jasmine testing framework and draws inspiration from another library similar to Mocky, [Funcy](https://github.com/bramstein/funcy).\r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\nSimply include mocky.js in your .html file. \r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n* Make a new Mocky object and load object with patterns. For `anObj` (below), if you call `anObj(2)`, you'll get `3`. If you call `anObj(3)`, you'll invoke the anonymous function that would call some function `foo()` and return `\"b1\"` as a result from `\"b\" + 1`. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar anObj = mocky(\r\n\t[2, 3], \r\n\t[1, 2],\r\n\t[3, function() {\r\n\t\ta = foo();\r\n\t\treturn \"b\" + 1}],\r\n\t[\"apple\", function (n) { return \"I like \" + n}],\r\n        [[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"],1],\r\n\t[_, \"wow!\"]\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n* You can use Mocky to perform recursion.\r\n```\r\nvar fact = mocky(\r\n       [0, 1],\r\n       [$, function(n) {return n * fact(n-1)}]\r\n);\r\n\r\nfact(3) // returns 6\r\n```\r\n\r\n* You can use a wildcard character and a param character depending on what you want to do. Like Funcy, Mocky allows you to define your own wildcard and param character. In the example, `_` and `$` were used, respectively. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar _ = mocky.any;\r\nvar $ = mocky.param;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo illustrate how these work, refer to the analogy below. If we have in Haskell (we shouldn't because the patterns overlap):\r\n```\r\nfoo _ = 1\r\nfoo n = n + 2\r\n```\r\nWe would represent this in Mocky as such:\r\n```\r\nvar foo = mocky(\r\n       [_, 1],\r\n       [$, function(n) {return n+2;}]\r\n);\r\n```\r\nBut Mocky validates against having both `_` and `$` in an instance and this would actually throw an error.\r\n\r\n* You can also use Mocky to pattern match arrays. \r\n \r\n### Additional Notes:\r\n* Mocky will match an input to the first available pattern, so the order of your patterns matter. \r\n\r\nThis will always return 1 because the wildcard is matched with all inputs.\r\n```\r\nvar bar = mocky(\r\n       [_ , 1],\r\n       [\"a\" , //doSomething]\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n* At this point, Mocky only takes one parameter. A pattern with multiple `$` is not accepted.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
